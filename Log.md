# Gameplay

So the gameplay is an "infinite runner" type game. We should investigate assets and also tutorials to check how infinite runners are done, so we don't reinvent the wheel and save us some time.



# 11 / 12 / 2019 - Getting Started


Okay, so we want to make a "hyper casual" mobile game. For us hyper casual really means something we can finish and ship quickly. And there seem to be no major blockers in getting this done.

At first we will ship on Android, and then iOS. So that will just cost us $25 to ship and get our product out there.

We are not really expecting to make too much money off this game, but we do want to monetize effectively like Crossy Road. We should follow the same sort of monetization Crossy Road does, since the gameplay is very similar.We believe we can make the gameplay as intriguing as Crossy Road. We do want however a "hipster" voxel art style, so we can add any sort of elements we need.

This is a great game idea, because this is something that we can actually implement easily. We will also need a "Score" up on top, to give the player a goal, and perhaps levels also. Again study Crossy Road because they have done this effectively.

Also, we want to keep our code and project as organized as possible so we have a smooth experience. There really should be no hassle in getting this done in under a week.

There is also that car asset pack we can use, to have more fun looking voxels.
