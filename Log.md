Okay, so we want to make a "hyper casual" mobile game. For us hyper casual really means something we can finish and ship quickly. And there seem to be no major blockers in getting this done.

At first we will ship on Android, and then iOS. So that will just cost us $25 to ship and get our product out there.

We are not really expecting to make too much money off this game, but we do want to monetize effectively like Crossy Road. We should follow the same sort of monetization Crossy Road does, since the gameplay is very similar.We believe we can make the gameplay as intriguing as Crossy Road. We do want however a "hipster" voxel art style, so we can add any sort of elements we need.
